### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search


### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Model Deployment

## Screen Recording
Due to company policy restrictions, screen recording is not permitted in the working environment. As a result, a video recording of the project execution cannot be provided. Instead, the project’s functionality and workflow are demonstrated through detailed screenshots and comprehensive step-by-step explanations included throughout this README.


## Standout Suggestions
To improve model accuracy performance, several approaches could be considered, including experimenting with additional feature engineering techniques or increasing the size of the training dataset. Deep learning was not enabled in this run in order to reduce execution time; however, it may be enabled in future runs to further explore potential performance gains.
